# Users Manual - 16/07/24

## Creating a User

To create a user, you need a unique ID from Taptics. This ID will connect you to your team, either as an admin or an athlete.

## Admin

As an admin, if you are on a PC, the main menu is your dashboard. From here you can:
- Create a new test for your teams
- See insights on your players
- Take the tests yourself

The whiteboard is where you add puzzles to your tests. You have a range of puzzle pieces you can use. To the left is a menu, where you can switch between teams and tests.

## Athlete

The athlete has two options:
1. **Test**: Use the tests that the coach has made.
2. **Test Results**: See how many rights and wrongs you got.

Additionally, the athlete can go to a profile page to change their details and the team they are on.
